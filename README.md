### Hey there! 👋
I'm Amogh Lele, a 21 year old 🚀 full-stack developer 🔨 working at [Navana](https://navanatech.in).

I frequently contribute to Open Source 🌿, and everything I build for myself is available out in the open. 
I'm a massive Kotlin 🅺 and Rust 🦀 enthusiast, so you might find me making a lot of projects with them involved.
More recently, I've taken up blogging at [sphericalk.at](https://sphericalk.at).

I'm an absolute sucker for domain hacks (as you might have guessed), and am somewhat of a domain collector.

### Shameless Plugs
