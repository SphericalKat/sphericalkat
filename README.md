### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Amogh Lele, a 22 year old ðŸš€ full-stack developer ðŸ”¨ working at [Dyte](https://dyte.io).

I frequently contribute to Open Source ðŸŒ¿, and everything I build for myself is available out in the open. 
I'm a massive [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) and [Rust ðŸ¦€](https://www.rust-lang.org) enthusiast, so you might find me making a lot of projects with them involved.
More recently, I've been exploring [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

I'm an absolute sucker for domain hacks and somewhat of a domain collector.

### Shameless Plug
Go use [katb.in](https://katb.in) for all your pastebin and URL ðŸ”— shortening needs.
